# Text and Image Analysis Project

## Text Analysis
Within this project, we obtained and examined restaurant reviews. The objective was to extract sentiment from these reviews and explore potential correlations between the sentiments expressed and the ratings of the restaurants.

## Image Analysis
This aspect of the project involved collecting facial images displaying various emotions. The primary goal was to develop a machine learning algorithm capable of predicting whether an emotion depicted in an image is neutral or otherwise (such as happy, angry, surprised, etc.).
